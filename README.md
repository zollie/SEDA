Staged Event Driven Architecture Framework
===

Based on [SEDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture)
published in 2001. This was initially written shortly after publication of that
paper and the first version of this is used in a high throughput image
processing system for a major corporation.

It's rewritten here for the public.

The original paper can be found [here](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/papers/seda-sosp01.pdf)
